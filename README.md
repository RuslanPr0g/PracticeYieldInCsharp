# PracticeYieldInCsharp
When you use the yield contextual keyword in a statement, you indicate that the method, operator, or get accessor in which it appears is an iterator. Using yield to define an iterator removes the need for an explicit extra class (the class that holds the state for an enumeration, see IEnumerator&lt;T> for an example) when you implement the IEnumerable and IEnumerator pattern for a custom collection type.
